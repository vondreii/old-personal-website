<h3> About the Game </h3>

<p>
    CyanX is a 2D platformer game based in the distant future in a world known as Khandren. 
    Flying robot enemies (also known as 'Nezbots') have captured animals and it is up to you to rescue them. 
    The game consists of different three locations. At each location, you must solve puzzles, level up, craft weapons 
    and defeat the Nezbots in order to reach and rescue the animals.
</p>

<h3> Aim </h3>

<p>
    The aim of the game is to progress to the end of each location by solving puzzles to rescue trapped animals. 
    You can also collect items which you can use to craft weapons (which can get more and more powerful the more you level up). 
    Experience points also allow you to level up and unlock certain abilities.  
</p>

<h3> Main Menu, Craftbox, and progress page </h3>

<p>
    The main menu allows you to open the Craftbox, where you can craft weapons based on what items you have collected. 
    You can also view what level you are currently on (from level 1 to 10).

<p> The concept design for this game included more than three locations: </p>

<h3> Collectables </h3>

<p>
    To be able to craft weapons, you have to collect certain resources, which are scattered throughout each location. 
    Some resources can craft more powerful weapons than others. Wood is the least powerful, and Ruby is the most powerful.
</p>

<ol>
    <li> Wood </li>
    <li> Stone </li>
    <li> Steel </li>
    <li> Blue Diamond </li>
    <li> Ruby </li>
</ol>

<p> In addition to resources, you can also collect: </p>

<ul>
    <li> <b>Stars: </b> You can collect experience points (yellow stars) which add up to your progress. After collecting a certain number of stars, you can progress to the next level. </li>
    <li> <b>Apples: </b> Apples will increase your health by one (this only works if you do not have 100% life). </li>
</ul>

<h3> Crafting Weapons </h3>

<p>
    Using collected resources, you can open the Craftbox and craft weapons. 
    The more powerful the resource, the more powerful the weapon. 
    The top of the Craftbox shows a list of all resources, and the number you have collected for each. 
    Below that is a list of weapons available to craft along with the number and types of resources you need in order to craft it. 
</p>

<p>
    If you do not have the available resources that are required, then you cannot craft the weapon. 
    Once you have crafted a weapon, you can equip it anytime by navigating back to the Craftbox and selecting 'equip.'
</p>

<h3> Enemies </h3>

<p>
    The enemies of the game are called Nezbots. 
    They are flying robots that guard captured animals and strategic entrance points to resources. 
    They are not hostile <b>(blue Nezbot)</b> unless you get too close, in which case they turn hostile <b>(red Nezbot)</b> and chase you. 
    They do not stop chasing you until you run far enough, or until you kill them <b>(black Nezbot)</b>. 
</p>

<h3> Levelling up </h3>

<p>
    The more experience points you collect, the more you are able to level up, therefore unlocking new abilities and weapons 
    that you can use to make gameplay easier. There is a maximum of 10 levels in the game. You start at level 1 at the beginning of the game. 
</p>

<p>
    Abilities you can unlock include earning more experience points for each animal rescued, strengthened health, 
    being able to craft more powerful weapons, being invincible to spikes and becoming an XP magnet (this is when experience points 
    float towards you when you get within a reasonable range to them).
