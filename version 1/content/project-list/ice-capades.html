<h3> About the Game </h3>

<p>
    Ice Capades is a Pokemon-style inspired game that aims to teach players about the affects of climate change on the environment. 
    You must pass through multiple levels, interact with objects, solve puzzles and avoid enemies in order to make your way to the oil rig 
    that is causing the ice in your village to melt.
</p>

<h3> Plot </h3>

<p>
    You play as a penguin living in a village in Antarctica. Your village is supported by snow and ice. An oil rig has recently been 
    built nearby and its operations have been slowly melting the ice due to the heat and intense steam produced, 
    therefore putting your village in danger. 
</p>

<h3> Aim </h3>

<p>
    The aim of the game is to make your way to the oil rig by avoiding enemies, collecting items and interacting with objects to solving puzzles. 
    Once at the oil rig, you must destroy it by reaching and turning off the main power switch. 
</p>

<h3> Tutorial </h3>

<p>
    When you start the game, you wake up inside your cottage. You are informed about the oil rig and how dangerous it is for the village. 
    This is the tutorial level where the game guides you through the basic gameplay: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li> 
        <b> How to interact with objects and the affects it has in the world. </b> For example, walking into the switch will activate the doors on the other side of the room).
    </li>
    <li> 
        <b> How to use scrolls. </b> You cannot pass through certain doors that are locked.
    </li>
    <li> 
        <b> Collecting collectables </b> such as diamonds or fish, which contribute to your points and leaderboard ranking.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Throughout the game you also come across other characters and animals that have been affected by the ice rig and melting ice.
</p>

<p>
    During the last level, you must navigate to the switch that shuts down the whole oil rig. 
    Turning the switch off sets all the power reactors on fire, apparently.
