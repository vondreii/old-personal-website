# old-personal-website
These are old versions of my personal website.

# Version 1

The first time I tried creating this website, I used Hugo, which uses pre-built themes from https://themes.gohugo.io/.

### To Run

Make sure you have Hugo installed on your computer. 

Use a terminal to navigate to the `version 1` folder.

Run `hugo serve`.

# Version 2

I converted the hugo site into a static HTML/CSS site.

### To Run

In the `version 2` folder, open `index.html`. It should open in a browser.
